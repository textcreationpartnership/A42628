            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>SINCE I gave my ſelf this Honour to acquaint your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes Army and that of <hi>France;</hi> This is to let you know, that the Enemy having paſſed the <hi>Sambre,</hi> it was neceſſary for me to go and meet them to prevent their Deſigns; ſo I gave the Van-Guard to Lieuetenant General <hi>Wembenum,</hi> with a great Party of the Horſe, and I my ſelf followed with the Body of the Army to <hi>Melle,</hi> where I Encampt: The General <hi>Flodorffs</hi> having been afterwards Commanded towards <hi>Namur,</hi> with Orders to do his Duty with that Garriſon; he brought word in his March, he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd nigh <hi>Flerans</hi> our Enemies Troops, and we had advice after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, that a great Body of their Army was in march, which ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged me to draw my Army up in Batallia. As for what paſs'd that day, between to Monſieur the <hi>Penſionaire Heynſius;</hi> ſo that your Highneſſes may be informed of him. When I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Enemy was returned to their Camp the ſame Night, the <hi>30th.</hi> of <hi>June,</hi> we reſted all night, and ranged in Batallia; and it was thought fit the Army ſhould be more advantageouſly poſted then it was now, but having underſtood the next Morning, that the <hi>French</hi> had not changed their ground, we thought it not neceſſary to remove without knowing where the Enemies marched, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently appeared, followed by the whole Army, which preſently draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up before that of your Highneſſeſs, and endeavoured to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round by marching along the Flanck of our left Wing. We endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured wite all the care imaginable to ſhun it, and draw'd ſome Troops from the Point of the Right Wing to reinforce the Flanck and the Rear: The Prince of <hi>Larbruge,</hi> Monſieur <hi>D'hubuy</hi> the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh General, and the Prince of <hi>Birckenfolt</hi> with the Brigadeers, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,

               </gap> firſt Lines, which was ſeconded by his Brigadeers. The Count <hi>Flodorff</hi> was ready at call; we diſpoſed of the Cannon and Baggage, the beſt way we thought fit. After which the Enemy both Foot and Horſe poured upon our Left Wing, and upon the Flank with ſo much fury, that ſeveral Squadrons of the 2 firſt Lines were put into diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, and had no ſooner reinforced them, but the <hi>French</hi> attacked a freſh our Horſe, which was ſupported by the Foot, who acted very Couragiouſly; the Lieutenant General <hi>Hubuy,</hi> was detached from the Right Wing, to attack the Enemy in the Flank, which they did with ſo much ſucceſs, that they brought off ſome of their Canon; but they being much more in Number then we, they poured upon us inſtantly with freſh Forces, which was vigorouſly ſuported 6 or 7 hours. After which having no more Horſe to aſſiſt us, we were obliged to attack both their Horſe and Foot, with our Foot only, who had ſo good Succeſs, that the <hi>French</hi> daring no more to attack us. I retreated with 9 whole Regiments, amongſt which were the Lieutenant General <hi>Ailva</hi> and <hi>Webbedum,</hi> and came to <hi>Niville,</hi> afterwards I brought them hither with four other Regiments, who joyned us in the March.</p>
            <p>The two Princes of <hi>Naſſaw,</hi> with ſeveral Regiments retired to <hi>Charle Roy,</hi> ſo that I cannot tell what Regiments remain; but according to the Report that is here, there be 20 yet in good condition, and ſeveral other indifferent, but not ſo bad, but that they may be quickly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruited: And your Highneſſeſs Forces have taken from the Enemy ſeveral Standards and Colours, of which I will give your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes an Account, as well as of the Officers and Souldiers that are killed, ſo ſoon as I ſhall have an Account my ſelf. We might have brought away ſome Canon from the Enemy with our Foot, had not our Horſe failed us. I have done my Duty as much as my advanced Age would permit: I could not prevent this ill Fortune. I hope that God will for the future bleſs your Highneſſes Arms with Succeſs, and that by a ſoon re-eſtabliſhment of your Army and other Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, may grant you a happy Campaign. We are making here a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, with a deſign to fight them again, ſo ſoon as the Electoral High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of <hi>Brandenburgh's</hi> Army ſhall arrive.</p>
